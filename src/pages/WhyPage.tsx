      <h2>Why We Built This App</h2>
      <p>
        Many online paint visualizers simply overlay a flat color onto your
        photo. Sites from brands like Benjamin Moore and Dunn-Edwards provide a
        quick preview, but the results often look unnatural and ignore the way
        light interacts with real surfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted a more accurate approach to help homeowners truly understand
        how a color will appear in their own space. By leveraging Meta's Segment
        Anything Model we can isolate surfaces with much greater precision and
        preserve the original lighting and shadows of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to experiment with modern segmentation techniques and offer
        a smoother workflow for exploring paint options. We hope this project
        sparks new ideas for improving the design tools available to everyone.
